# Liskov Substitution Principle

## Intent

### Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

#### Variation of the Open Close Principle
- A derived class does not have an implementation for all methods.
- Different substitutes return things of different types.
- A derived class is less permissive with regard to method arguments.
- Secretly programming against a more specific type.
